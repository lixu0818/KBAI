solving RPM problems with an AI agent

Raven's progressive Matrices (RPMs), written in 1930s, are multiple-choice questions composed of non-verbal presentations that ask the subject to identify the missing element according to their patterns. They are generally in forms of 2x2, 3x3 or even more complex matrices, see example in Figure 1.  RPMs are the best and most popular intelligence test of all time" -- according to Wikipedia and **"the gold standard in intelligence test"** -- according to CNN. Thus they have been used to test IQ value of children, elderly and possibly mentally-impaired individuals. One popular aspect of AI is knowledge-based AI, is based on unifying 3 fundamental processes of Reason-Learning-Memory, mimicking how human brain processes knowledge from the environment. Since the agent I built exhibits human-like intelligence, RPMs are good tests to examine and compare how good our strategies are in terms of making the agent "intelligent".
